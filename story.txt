	Once upon a time there was a very hungry man. This man's name was
Alfred. Alfred had a strange medical condition where his stomach was 8 times
the size of a regular stomach. This caused him to be hungry all the time.
Coincidentally, he had another condition which made his mouth 8 times the size
of a normal mouth.
