	Once upon a time there was a very hungry man. This man's name was
Alfred. Alfred had a strange medical condition where his stomach was 8 times
the size of a regular stomach. This caused him to be hungry all the time.
Coincidentally, he had another condition which made his mouth 8 times the size
of a normal mouth.
	The mix of these two conditions actually seemed to be a blessing as
Alfred's large mouth allows him to eat an immense amount of food to fill his
stomach. Alfred often gets strange looks from others when he eats, not because
of his physical appearance, but because of the way he eats. Instead of using
utensils like a regular person, he drops the whole plate of food into his mouth at once. 
	Alfred was tired of feeling like a freak whenever he eats so he tried 
using spoons when he ate. This just didn't work for him becuase he was eating
too slow and couldn't keep up with his stomach. Luckily, Alfred had years of
welding expirience and had a great idea to weld 8 spoons together, this 
design was ideal for his eating habits.
	After weeks of using this spoon out in public, he recieved many commentson how handy that looked and that they would consider buying one. Seeing as
Alfred was going broke due to his eating habits, he decided to try to produce
these spoons to sell. He would call it "The Ideal Octo-Spoon". Alfred worked dayand night with almost no rest to get his product off the ground.
	It only took 2 months for Alfred to make his first million dollars off 
his genius idea. His first major purchase was surgury to reduce his stomach
size. Next was mouth surgury. Alfred is now a normal man but he continues to
produce "The Ideal Octo-Spoon". The End.
